	This is an addon for World of Warcraft that adds statistical history to the auction data that is collected
	when the auction is scanned, so that you can easily determine what price
	you will be able to sell an item for at auction or at a vendor whenever you
	mouse-over an item in the game

	CoreFinal is the last Core Auctioneer file to be loaded

	CoreFinal will:
		Finalize internal checking procedures initialized in CoreManifest and CoreModule
		Perform or trigger other load-time integrity checks

	About the ABORTLOAD flag
		CoreManifest, and certain other Core modules, will set the ABORTLOAD flag
		if they detect a critical problem during loading.
		CoreFinal performs or triggers checks that may set this flag
